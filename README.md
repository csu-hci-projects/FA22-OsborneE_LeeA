This simple game can be started by pressing "5" on your keyboard, or by using the green start arrow on the upper part of your screen. 6 on your keyboard will stop the game, and 0 will stop the balls movement. WASD and your arrow keys can be used to move the ball left/right and forwards/backwards. Your space bar will cause your ball to "jump". 

Your objective is to make it to the gold ring at the end of each level, which will bring you to the next one. The levels will progressively get more and more difficult so watch out!
